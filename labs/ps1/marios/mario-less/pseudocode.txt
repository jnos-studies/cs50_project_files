1. Make a loop which asks for the user input. If the input is lower than 1 and
   greater than 8, persist in the loop, otherwise break out of it.

                IN an O(n^2) Algorithem
2. Print a newline character.

3. Create a variable which keeps track of required amount of spaces one will need
   when iterating through the columns.

4. If the iteration through the column is less than the user height,
        print spaces.
   Otherwise,
        print hashes.

5. Decrease the number of spaces required for each iteration through a row and print a blank space.
